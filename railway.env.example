# Optional behaviour: if SENTRY_DSN is set at container start, the startup script
# will attempt to ensure the Sentry SDK is available by installing it at runtime.
# This is useful when you don't want Sentry bundled into the image. To opt out of
# runtime installation, set:
# SENTRY_INSTALL_ON_STARTUP=false

# Optional feature flags
ENABLE_BACKGROUND_INGEST=false

# Notes:
# - Add secrets in Railway under the service's Environment > Variables or via GitHub Actions Secrets.
# - Keep this file out of source control when populated with real secrets.
